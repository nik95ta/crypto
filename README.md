## My Decisions :pencil:Ô∏è

**Refactoring**
I decided to refactor this project and have committed this refactored version with the following changes:

- Moved meta HTML tags to `_document.page.tsx`
- Fixed a typo in `pages/api/tokens.page.ts`
- Added names for coins in another language
- Corrected the `NavBar` component name
- Removed unused code

**Features added**

- Generating public and private Bitcoin addresses using the `bs58` and `elliptic` packages
- Displaying a list of selected tokens upon initially opening the manage page
- Implemented debouncing for searches using a custom hook
- Enabled searching by Persian names
- Utilized Redux Toolkit for enhanced management of the list of selected tokens
- Added a fixed footer for the manage token button
- Added some unit tests

## Areas for Improvement :hourglass:

- Enhancing the UX for an empty list to be more user-friendly
- Adding a clear button for the search input for improved usability
- Implemented additional tests to improve code coverage
- Optimizing styles
